## !Linkerator

![](Linkerator.gif)

Have you ever wanted to tell your friends about some impressive loot you saw another adventurer using? Share your regret about the quest reward you foolishly didn't choose? Spread word to your guild of what your raiding party found?

This is a modern revival of Gazmik Fizzwidget's classic **Linkerator** addon! It brings back the simple, intuitive linking functionality we all loved, but now it's powered by the massive and up-to-date **Ludwig** item database.

### Features

-   **Automatic Item Linking:** Allows you to insert an item link in chat by merely typing its name in brackets. For example, typing `/g [Arcanite Bar]` will automatically send a message to your guild with a clickable link.
-   **Live Autocomplete:** As you type a link like `[Arcan...`, possible completions will appear. Pressing **Tab** or closing with **`]`** allows you to instantly complete the item name.
-   **Paste and Go:** You can copy and paste entire messages that already contain item links, and they will be preserved perfectly. Any un-linked items in brackets will be converted automatically when you send.
-   **Link by Item ID:** If you know an item's ID number, you can type it in brackets with a `#` to link it (e.g., `[#19019]` will link `[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]`).

### Installation (Required!)

This addon is a bridge for Ludwig and **will not work without it.**

1.   First, make sure you have **Ludwig** and **Ludwig\_Data** installed. You can get them from the official CurseForge page: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ludwig](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ludwig)
2.   Install **!Linkerator**.
3.   Ensure all three folders (`Ludwig`, `Ludwig_Data`, and `!Linkerator`) are in your `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\` folder.

There is no configuration required. If Ludwig is installed, this addon will work.

### Credits
